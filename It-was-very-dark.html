              <p>It was really dark.  Rusty could feel something was close.  The youthful tomcat's eyes opened wide as he watched the dense undergrowth.  This place was unknown, but the odd scents drew him forward, deeper into the shadows. He opened his limbs slightly to allow the warm aromas of the woods to reach the scent glands onto the roof of the mouth.  Musty odors of leaf mould pop together with all the enticing aroma of a tiny pet animal.<p>

                <p>Suddenly a flash of grey hurried past him.  Rusty stopped listening.   Rusty understood it was a mousehe could feel that the rapid pulsing of a very small heart deep inside his ear coat.   Shortly his desire will be fulfilled.<p>
                
                <p>Diminished he lowered his body into place, crouching to the assault.   He understood it wasn't mindful of him.  With one last test on his victim's place, Rusty pushed hard onto his haunches and sprang, kicking up leaves on the forest floor as he climbed. But Rusty was on top of it.<p>
                
                <p>He divides it into the atmosphere, hooking the helpless monster with his thorn-sharp claws, then flinging it up at a high arc on the leaf-covered floor.  The mouse landed alive but alive.  It attempted to operate, but Rusty snatched this up again.<p>
                
                <p>He pitched the mouse once again, this time a bit farther away.  The mouse was able to scramble several paces until Rusty caught up with it.</p>
                
                <p>Suddenly a sound roared nearby.  Rusty looked about, and as he did so, the mouse managed to pull off from his claws.  After Rusty turned back he found it dart to the shadow among the tangled roots of a tree.</p>
                
                <p>He spun around, his eyes glaring, intent on looking out the sound that had cost him his kill.  The noise rattled on, getting more familiar.</p>
                
                <p>The woods had vanished.  He had been within a hot and kitchen curled in his bed.  Moonlight filtered through the window, casting shadows onto the smooth, hard flooring.  The sound was the rattle of tough, dried beans of food since they were leaned into his dish.  Rusty was dreaming.</p>
                
                <p>His collar rubbed uncomfortably around his throat.  In his fantasy, he'd sensed refreshing air ruffling the fur in which the collar generally pinched.  Rusty rolled onto</p>
                
                <p>His back, savoring the fantasy to get a few more minutes.   This was the third time since full moon he'd had the dream and each time that the mouse had escaped his grip.</p>
                
                <p>From his bed, he can smell the dull odor of his or her food.  His owners consistently refilled his dish until they went to bed.</p>
                
                <p>The dusty odor chased off the warm aromas of his fantasy.  However, the appetite rumbled on in his belly, so Rusty extended the sleep from his limbs and padded throughout the kitchen floor into his dinner.  The meals felt sterile and dry on his tongue.  Rusty reluctantly swallowed a more mouthful.</p>
                <p>Shocked yowls rose in the Clan cats and echoed throughout the woods. Ravenpaw staggered somewhat. "We m-met five RiverClan warriors together with the stream, not far in the Sunningrocks," he proceeded shakily. "Oakheart was one of them." "He's the deputy of RiverClan. He is among the best warriors in the woods. Lucky Ravenpaw! Wish it would have been me. I would have actually " Graypaw was quieted with a ferocious glance from the older grey tom who had sensed Ravenpaw's return.</p><p>Firepaw switched his focus back to Ravenpaw. "Redtail cautioned Oakheart to maintain his hunting parties from ThunderClan territory. He said another RiverClan warrior to be captured in ThunderClan land would be murdered, but Oak...Oakheart wouldn't back down. He explained his Cl-Clan needed to be fed up, whatever we jeopardized " Ravenpaw stopped to wheeze for breath.</p><p>His wound was bleeding heavily, and that he stood to keep the burden off his knee. "That is if the RiverClan cats assaulted. It was difficult to find out what was occurring. I saw Oakheart'd Redtail pinned into the floor, but Redtail..." Unexpectedly Ravenpaw's eyes rolled in his mind and that he lurched sideways. A ginger queen bounded toward him crouched in his side. Out of this fern-shaded corner trotted the fairly tortoiseshell Firepaw had detected sitting beside Graypaw earlier.</p><p>Then she used her little pink nose to roll up the apprentice over so she could have a fantastic look in the wound. She glanced up and meowed, "It is all right, Goldenflower, his wounds are not fatal. But I will have to bring some cobwebs to halt the bleeding" Since Spottedleaf reunites to the den, the silent silence at the clearing was busted by a mournful howl. All eyes turned into the way it had come out of.</p><p>Between his sharp teeth that the warrior held not victim, but the dead body of another cat. He pulled the tattered monster into the center of this clearing.</p><p>Firepaw craned his neck and also glimpsed a flash of ginger tail dangling limply from the dust. Shock rippled throughout the Clan just like a cool breeze. Beside Firepaw, Graypaw fell to a crouch as despair trapped. "How did this occur, Tigerclaw?" Demanded Bluestar from her place on the Highrock. Tigerclaw allows the scruff of Redtail's neck to drop out of his mouth. He appeared back at Bluestar. "He died with honor, struck by Oakheart. I could not save him but I was able to take Oakheart's life while he was gloating over his success." Tigerclaw's voice was deep and strong. "Redtail's death wasn't in vain, for I doubt we will see RiverClan hunters in our land " The apprentice's eyes were darkened with despair.</p><p>After a minute's pause, a number of the cats moved ahead to lick at Redtail's bedraggled fur. As they dressed they purred silent phrases into the deceased warrior.</p><p>Graypaw did not take his eyes away from the dead cat since he responded. "His soul may have made to combine StarClan,</p><p>However, the Clan will discuss tongues with Redtail one final time." Firepaw echoed. "It is the tribe of celestial warriors who watches over most Clan cats. You may view them Silverpelt." Firepaw appeared puzzled, therefore Graypaw explained.</p><p>"Silverpelt is that thick group of stars you find every night extending across the skies. Each celebrity is a StarClan warrior. Redtail will be one of them ." Firepaw nodded, and Graypaw stepped forward to discuss tongues together with his deceased deputy. Bluestar had stayed silent while the initial cats arrived to pay their respects to Redtail. She jumped down in the Highrock and walked slowly toward Redtail's entire body. Another cat retreated and viewed as their chief crouched down to discuss tongues together with her older comrade one final moment.</p><p>When she'd finished she raised her head and talked. Her voice was thick with despair, along with the Clan appeared in silence. "Redtail was a courageous warrior. His devotion to ThunderClan could not be doubted. I relied on his judgment, for it bore witness to the demands of this Clan, and was not swayed by self-interest or pride. He'd have made a nice leader" Then she lowered herself on her stomach, her head bowed her paws stretched before her, and she grieved for her missing friend. Firepaw watched. He'd not understood Redtail, but he could not help feeling proceeded as he witnessed that the Clan mourn. Graypaw arrived and stood beside him. "Dustpaw is going to be miserable," he commented.</p><p>This brown-striped tabby around there. Firepaw glanced over in the little tom who squatted near Redtail's figure, staring unseeing at the floor. Firepaw looked beyond him into the Clan leader. "Just how long will Blusetar sit ?" he asked. "Probably the entire night," responded Graypaw. She won't need to let him move too fast. He had been among the greatest warriors. Not as large and strong as Tigerclaw or even Lionheart, but smart and quick." Firepaw appeared at Tigerclaw, admiring the power that swelled within his strong muscles and wide mind.</p><p>His large body showed signs of his warrior lifestyle. One of his ears has been divided into a deep vee shape, along with a thick scar slit the bridge of the nose.</p><p>Unexpectedly Tigerclaw stood up and stalked around to Ravenpaw. Firepaw leaned toward Graypaw and inquired, "What is Spottedleaf doing?" It seemed just like a horrible cut. And Ravenpaw appeared really shaken up. Let us go and see whether he is awakened yet."</p><p>They made their way through the grieving cats in the place where Ravenpaw put and settled themselves a respectful distance off to wait till Tigerclaw had finished talking. "Thus, Spottedleaf." Tigerclaw dealt with the tortoiseshell using a certain meow.</p><p>"What's he? Do you believe that you can save him? I have spent a great deal of time up training, and that I do not need my efforts to be squandered in the very first battle." Spottedleaf did not look up from her individual as she responded. "Yes, a shame if, after all of your precious coaching, he cries in his very first battle, eh?"  Tigerclaw demanded. "Obviously. He only needs to break." Tigerclaw snorted and looked down at the darkened black form. He jabbed Ravenpaw with a few of the front claws. "Come, then! Ravenpaw did not move.</p><p>"Consider the length of the claw!" Firepaw hissed. "Too perfect!" Answered Graypaw with the atmosphere. "I know I would not want to get into a battle !" "Not too quickly, Tigerclaw!" Spottedleaf put her paw over Tigerclaw's sharp talon and softly moved it off. "This apprentice should keep as much as possible before the cut has healed. We do not need him opening his wound by leaping about trying to please you.  He guessed that cats dared to give orders to the warrior such as that.</p><p>The significant tabby stiffened, and appeared about to speak if Spottedleaf mewed teasingly, "You know better than to contend with a medication cat, Tigerclaw." Tigerclaw's eyes flashed in the tiny tortoiseshell's words. "I would not dare argue with you, beloved Spottedleaf," he purred. "Who is this?" He inquired Graypaw, towering over them. "He is the newest apprentice," Graypaw mewed.</p><p> "I had been a house cat," Firepaw meowed boldly, "but that I will train for a warrior" Tigerclaw looked at him with interest. Now I recall. Bluestar said that she'd stumbled upon several stray kitty pet. So she is going to test out you, is she?" "That is appropriate," he</p><p> "Then I will watch your progress with curiosity." Firepaw puffed out his chest as Tigerclaw stalked away. "Do you believe he liked me?" "I do not think Tigerclaw enjoys any apprentices!" whispered Graypaw. Only then Ravenpaw awakened and twitched his ears. he mumbled. "Who? Tigerclaw?" Responded Graypaw, trotting him off. "Yep, he has gone." "Hi there," Firepaw started, about to present himself. Spottedleaf protested. "Just how am I supposed to assist this kitty with these shocks!" She impatiently flicked her tail in Graypaw and Firepaw and pushed her way between her individual.</p><p>Firepaw understood she was serious, regardless of the playful glimmer in her warm amber eyes. "I will show you all around. The 2 cats left Spottedleaf with Ravenpaw and walked around the clearing. Graypaw seemed thoughtful. He was obviously taking his responsibilities as a manual quite seriously. "You understand the Highrock already," he started, flicking his tail toward the large, smooth stone. "Bluestar always covers the Clan out there. Her den is down " He raised his nose hollow at the face of the Highrock. Hanging lichen draped the entry, sheltering the leader's nest out of rain and wind. "The Warriors sleep here," Graypaw proceeded.</p><p>Firepaw followed closely into a huge bush several paces away in the Highrock. There was a very clear view from here down to the gorse entry into the camp. The branches of the bush hung low, but Firepaw can observe a sheltered space indoors where the warriors left their nests. "The elderly warriors sleep closest to the center, in which it is warmest," clarified Graypaw. "They usually discuss their fresh-kill collectively over by this clump of nettles. The younger players consume nearby. Occasionally they're encouraged to join the senior warriors for ingestion, and it is a major honor." "What about another Clan cats?" Firepaw requested, fascinated but feeling quite overwhelmed with the customs and principles of Clan life.</p><p>"The queens discuss tribe quarters whenever they function as musicians, however, if they're anticipating kits, or nursing them they remain in a nest close to the nursery. The elders have their very own place on the opposite side of this clearing. Come, I will show you." They stopped beside a tree that sheltered a patch of lush grass. Crouched one of the tender greenery were four older cats tucked right into a chubby young bunny. "Dustpaw and Sandpaw could have attracted them," whispered Graypaw.</p><p>"Among the apprentices' responsibilities is grabbing fresh-kill for the elders." "Hello, child," among those elders greeted Graypaw. "This has to be our brand new apprentice. Firepaw, is not it?" Meowed another tom. His patchy fur was dark brown, and there was just a stump where his tail should've been. "That is correct," Firepaw responded, replicating Graypaw's nod. "I am Halftail," purred the brownish tom. "Have you eaten?" meowed Smaller.</p><p>"Well, there is enough here. Dustpan and Sandpaw are turning to fine hunters. Do you mind if those kids shared with a mouse one-eye?"</p><p>The light gray queen that lay beside him shook her head. Firepaw noticed among her eyes had been fuzzy and sightless. Another elder, a tortoiseshell she-cat using a grey muzzle, meowed at a voice cracked with age, "Obviously not." He stepped forward and took a sizable mouse in the heap of the victim, then dropped it in Firepaw's feet. "You did not taste mouse," he asked.</p><p>He felt excited with the hot scents that were climbing from this bit of fresh-kill. His entire body quivered in the idea of sharing his very first actual meals as a Clan member. "In that scenario, you can get an initial bite. Only save me a while!" Graypaw dipped his mind and stood back to provide Firepaw room. Firepaw crouched down and took a huge bite in the mouse. It was tender and succulent and filmed with the tastes of this woods.</p><p>"What do you believe?" Requested Graypaw. Excellent!" Mumbled Firepaw, his mouth full. "Move over afterward," mewed Graypaw, stepping forwards and bending his mind to have a bite. Since the two apprentices shared with the mouse, they listened to the priests speak among themselves. "Just how long until Bluestar appoints a new deputy?" Requested Smaller.</p><p>"What did you say,'' Smaller?" mewed One-eye. "I believe that your hearing is becoming as bad as your vision!" Snapped Smaller impatiently. "I said, just how long until Bluestar appoints a new deputy?" One-eye dismissed Smallear's annoyed response and talked instead into the tortoiseshell queen.</p><p> It wasn't long after she dropped her kits"</p><p>"She will not be pleased to be appointing a new deputy," Smaller observed. "Redtail functioned her long also. However, she will have to compose her mind fast. In accordance with the Clan's habit, the decision needs to be made prior to moonlight following the passing of this older deputy." "At least now the decision is clear," meowed Halftail.</p><p>Firepaw increased his head and looked around the clearing. Who would Halftail mean? To Firepaw, most of the warriors seemed worthy of getting deputy. Maybe he supposed Tigerclaw; afterwards, he had avenged Redtail's departure. Since Firepaw stretched with his tongue to lick at the very last traces of mouse out of his whiskers, Bluestar's voice called by the Highrock. Redtail's body lay in the clearing below, light grey in the fading light. "A brand new deputy has to be appointed," she meowed.</p><p>"But first, let's give thanks for StarClan to the life span of Redtail. Silence fell as each of the cats looked up into the skies, which was starting to darken as the day crept over the woods. "I say these words prior to the entire body of Redtail, in order that his soul may hear and approve my decision." Firepaw appeared at Tigerclaw. He could not help noticing the desire from the major warrior's manly eyes as he stared up in the Highrock. "Lionheart," meowed Bluestar, "are the newest deputy of ThunderClan." Firepaw was curious to determine Tigerclaw's response. Nevertheless, the dark warrior's face showed nothing as he transferred into congratulate Lionheart using a nudge so believable it virtually pushed the gold tabby off equilibrium.</p><p>"Why did not she create Tigerclaw deputy?" "Likely because Lionheart continues to be a warrior more, so he's Much More experience," Graypaw</p><p>Reunite, still looking up at Bluestar. Bluestar spoke. "Redtail was a mentor to young Dustpaw. Because there should be no delay from the</p><p>Coaching of our apprentices, I will appoint Dustpaw's new mentor instantly. Darkstripe, you're prepared for your very first apprentice, which means you will endure Dustpaw's training. You had a nice mentor at Tigerclaw, and that I hope you to pass on a few of the skills you were taught."</p><p>Dustpan flicked his tail, but his eyes were dull with grief for his missing mentor. Bluestar increased her voice. "I will maintain a vigil with Redtail's body before we bury him ." Many</p><p>Of those other cats joined her, Dustpaw and Smaller one of them. "If we sit together with them also?" Firepaw suggested. He had to acknowledge the idea did not appeal to him considerably.</p><p>It was a hectic afternoon and he was starting to feel drowsy. He wanted to do was find someplace warm and</p><p>"No, just those who have been nearest to Redtail will discuss his closing night. I will explain to you where we all sleep. Firepaw followed Graypaw into some thick bush of ferns that layout on a mossy tree stump. "Each of the apprentices discusses their fresh-kill at this stump," Graypaw informed him.</p><p>"The number of apprentices are there?" Firepaw asked. Since Graypaw and Firepaw settled themselves together with the tree stump, a youthful she-cat crawled from underneath the ferns. Her jacket was ginger, such as Firepaw's, however much paler, with hardly visible stripes of fur.</p><p>"Here comes the brand new apprentice!"</p><p>Do not tell me I will need to discuss my nest with this disgusting stench!" Firepaw felt quite taken aback. Since his struggle Longtail, all of the cats had been very friendly. Perhaps they'd only been diverted by Ravenpaw's news,'' he believed. "I believe she should have a furball trapped someplace.  "Hold, kids." The voice of Whitestorm appeared supporting the apprentices. "Sandpaw! As my apprentice, I anticipated being a bit more welcoming to this newcomer." Sandpaw held her head up and seemed rebellious. "I simply didn't expect to be coaching using a kittypet, that is all!"</p><p>"I am confident that you'll become accustomed to it, Sandpaw," meowed Whitestorm calmly. "Now, it is getting late, and coaching begins early. You should find some sleep" As he walked, she spun about and disappeared to the clump of ferns, sniffing once again as she brushed past Firepaw. With a flick of his tail, Graypaw encouraged Firepaw to accompany him and led the way afterward Sandpaw. In the sleeping place, the ground has been lined with soft ribbon, as well as the pale moonlight turned into everything a delicate shade of green. The air was fragrant with fern odor, and warmer than outdoors. Firepaw asked.</p><p>"Anywhere, so long as it isn't me!" Snarled Sandpaw, that had been prodding some moss with her paw. Graypaw and Firepaw exchanged glances, however, said nothing. Firepaw raked along a heap of moss along with his claws. When he had accumulated his bed into a cozy nest, then he circled till it was comfy and settled. His entire body felt tired with bliss. This was his house today. He was a part of ThunderClan.</p>
