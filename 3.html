              <p>Hissed Bluestar, her face just a mouse-length out of his today. Lionheart remained quiet as He flattened his ears crouched below the gold warrior's cold stare. "You endanger our Clan if you choose our meals," yowled Bluestar. "You have Lots of food on your</p><p>Twoleg nest. You come here just to search for a game. But we search to live." The Fact of the warrior queen's voice pierced Rusty such as blackthorn, and he knew her He ceased trembling, awakened, and straightened his ears. "I'd no idea of it that way before. "I won't search here ."</p><p>Bluestar allows her hackles autumn and suggested to Lionheart to measure back. "You're an odd kitty pet, Graypaw's bit of relief produced Rusty's ears. He heard the acceptance in Bluestar's voice and</p><p>The appearance made him interested. What flashed Involving the 2 warriors? Quietly he inquired, "Is survival really so difficult?" "Our land covers only a part of the woods," replied Bluestar.</p><p>What we've. And this season, new leaf that is late means prey is rare." "Is the Clan very significant?"</p><p>"Our land can encourage us but there isn't any prey left ." "Have you been warriors, then?" Rusty mewed. Bluestar's guarded replies were only making him more interested. Lionheart answered. "Many are warriors. To search." "And you live and discuss prey collectively?"</p><p>Rusty murmured in amazement, believing a bit guiltily of the very own Simple, egocentric life. Bluestar appeared again in Lionheart. The gold tabby stared back at her. Her gaze into Rusty and meowed, "Maybe you ought to find these things out on your own. Do you want to combine</p><p>ThunderClan?" Rusty was surprised, he could not speak. Bluestar went: "In case you did, then you'd train with Graypaw to develop into a Clan warrior" "However, kitty pets can not be warriors!" "They do not have warrior blood" A gloomy look fuzzy Bluestar's eyes. "Too much of this was spilled recently."</p><p>There's no guarantee you'd develop into a complete warrior. It may prove too hard for you. After all, You're Utilized to some He swung his head around to confront the gold tabby. "Why provide</p><p>Me the opportunity, then?" But it had been Bluestar who replied. "You're correct to question our reasons, youthful one. The Truth Is,</p><p>ThunderClan wants more warriors" "Understand that Bluestar doesn't make this deal gently," cautioned Lionheart. "If You Would like to train Together with us, we'll need to take you to our Clan. You need to either reside together and respect our manners or reunite</p><p>To a Twolegplace rather than return. You can't live with a paw in every world."He shivered, not with all the chilly, but with Excitement in the extraordinary possibilities opening up facing him.</p><p>"Have you been wondering whether it is worth giving your comfy kitty pet life" Requested Bluestar softly. "However Do you understand the purchase price that you will pay for your food and warmth?"</p><p>Certainly, his experience with those cats had demonstrated to him how simple and</p><p>Luxury his lifestyle was. "I will tell that you're a tom," Bluestar added, "regardless of the Twoleg stench that clings to a fur"</p><p>"What can you mean--nevertheless a tom?" "You have not been accepted by the Twolegs to observe that the Cutter," meowed Bluestar gravely. "You'd</p><p>Be quite different then. Not quite so eager to battle Clan cat, I guess!" Rusty has been perplexed. He suddenly thought of Henry, who was fat and idle since his trip to the Was that what Bluestar supposed from the Cutter?</p><p>"The Clan might not have the ability to give you such simple warmth or food," lasted Bluestar. "From the season Of all leaf-bare, nights at the woods could be unkind. The Clan will require great loyalty and hard labor.</p><p>You'll be Anticipated to guard the Clan along with your own life if needed. And there are lots of mouths to feed. However, rewards Are fantastic. You may continue being a tom. You'll be educated in the ways of the wild. You may learn what it's to be a</p><p>Actual cat. Bluestar appeared to be offering him the life he'd lived a lot of occasions, and so</p><p>Tantalizingly, in his fantasies, but would he live like this for real? Lionheart interrupted his ideas. "Come, Bluestar, let us not waste any more time.</p><p>We must be prepared to join another patrol in the sky-high. Tigerclaw will wonder what's become of us." He awakened and "Can I consider your deal?"</p><p>"Lionheart is here at sunlight high," She advised him. "Give him your response then." Bluestar murmured a low signal, and at one motion the 3 cats turned and vanished into That the undergrowth. He awakened --excited, cloudy --upward beyond the ferns that surrounded him through the canopy</p><p>Of leaves to the stars which glittered from the crystal clear sky. The odor of this Clan cats hung heavy in the night atmosphere.</p><p>As Rusty turned and headed for home, he felt a peculiar feeling inside him, yanking him into the depths of this woods. His fur prickled deliciously from the mild breeze, and the rustling leaves appeared to whisper his name to the shadows.</p><p>It'd been raining lightly. Rusty stalked the blank backyard, following the starlit gravel path, feeling the stones cold and sharp under his toenails.</p><p>He abandoned his dirt below a large bush with glossy green leaves and thick purple blossoms. Their sickly sweet odor cloyed the moist atmosphere around him and then he curled his lip to push the odor of the nostrils. </p>
              <p>Chapter one. It was very dark Rusty couldsense something was near. The young tomcat's eyes opened wideas he scanned the dense undergrowth. This place was unfamiliar but the strange sense drew himonward deeper into the shadows. His stomach growled,reminding him of his hunger.</p><p>He opened his jaw slightlyto let the warm smells of the forest reach the scentglands on the roof of his mouth. Musty odors of leaf mold mingled with thetempting aroma of a small, furry creature. Suddenly, a flash of gray raced past him,Rusty stopped still, listening. It was hiding in the leaves lessthan two tail lengths away. Rusty knew it was a mouse. He could feel the rapid pulsing ofa tiny heart deep within his ear fur. He swallowed,stifling his rumbling stomach. Soon, his hunger would be satisfied. Slowly, he lowered his body into position,crouching for the attack.</p><p>He was downwind of the mouse. He knew it was not aware of him. With one final check on his praisedposition, Rusty pushed back hard on his haunches and sprang, kickingup leaves on the forest floor as he rose. The mouse dived for cover,heading toward a hole in the ground, but Rusty was already on top of it.</p><p>He scooped it into the air, hookingthe helpless creature with his thorn-sharp claws, flinging it up in a higharc over the leaf covered ground. The mouse landed dazed, but alive. It tried to run, butRusty snatched it up again. He tossed the mouse once more,this time a little farther away. The mouse managed to scramble a fewpaces before Rusty caught up with it. Suddenly, a noise roared nearby. Rusty looked around.</p><p>And as he did, so the mouse wasable to pull away from his claws. When Rusty turned back, he saw it dart into the darknessamong the tangled roots of a tree. Angry, Rusty gave up the hunt. He spun around, his green eyes glaring, intent on searching out the noisethat had cost him his kill. The sound rattled on,becoming more familiar. Rusty blinked open his eyes. The forest had disappeared. He was inside a hot andairless kitchen, curled in his bed. Moonlight filtered through the window,casting shadows on the smooth hard floor. The noise had been the rattleof hard dried pellets of food as they were tipped into his dish.</p><p>Rusty had been dreaming. Lifting his head,he rested his chin on the side of his bed. His collar rubbeduncomfortably around his neck. In his dream, he had felt fresh air ruffling the softfur where the collar usually pinched. Rusty rolled onto his back,savoring the dream for a few more moments. He could still smell mouse. It was the third time since fullmoon that he'd had the dream, and every time,the mouse had escaped his grasp. He licked his lips. From his bed,he could smell the bland odor of his food. His owners always refilled hisdish before they went to bed. The dusty smell chased awaythe warm sense of his dream.</p><p>But the hunger rumbled on in his stomach,so Rusty stretched the sleep out of his limbs and padded acrossthe kitchen floor to his dinner. The food felt dry andtasteless on his tongue. Rusty reluctantly swallowedone more mouthful. Then, he turned awayfrom the food dish and pushed his way out through the cat flap, hoping that the smell of the garden wouldbring back the feelings from his dream. Outside, the moon was bright. It was raining lightly. Rusty stalked down the tidy garden,following the starlit gravel path, feeling the stones cold andsharp beneath his paws.</p><p>He made his dirt beneath a largebush with glossy green leaves and heavy purple flowers. Their sickly sweet scent cloyedthe damp air around him, and he curled his lip to drivethe smell out of his nostrils. Afterward, Rusty settled down on top ofone of the posts in the fence that marked the limits of his garden. It was a favorite spot of his as he couldsee right into the neighboring gardens as well as into the dense green foreston the other side of the garden fence.</p><p>The rain had stopped. Behind him, the close croppedlawn was bathed in moonlight, but beyond his fence,the woods were full of shadows. Rusty stretched his head forwardto take a sniff of the damp air. His skin was warm anddry under his thick coat, but he could feel the weight of the raindropsthat sparkled on his ginger fur. He heard his owners giving himone last call from the back door. If he went to them now, they would greethim with gentle words and caresses and welcome him onto their bedwhere he would curl, purring, warm in the crook of a bent knee.</p><p>But this time,Rusty ignored his owners' voices and turned his gaze back to the forest. The crisp smell of the woods hadgrown fresher after the rain. Suddenly, the fur on his spine prickled. Was something moving out there? Was something watching him? Rusty stared ahead, butit was impossible to see or smell anything in the dark,tree-scented air. He lifted his chin boldly, stood up andstretched, one paw gripping each corner of the fence post as he straightenedhis legs and arched his back.</p><p>He closed his eyes and breathed inthe smell of the woods once more. It seemed to promise him something, tempting him onward intothe whispering shadows. Tensing his muscles,he crouched for a moment. Then, he leaped rightlydown into the rough grass on the other sideof the garden fence. As he landed, the bell on his collarrang out through the still night air. Where are you off to, Rusty? Meowed a familiar voice behind him. Rusty looked up. A young black and white cat wasbalancing ungracefully on the fence. Hello, Smudge, Rusty replied.</p><p>You're not going to go into the woods,are you? Smudge's amber eyes were huge. Just for a look, Rusty promised,shifting uncomfortably. You wouldn't get me in there,it's dangerous. Smudge wrinkled his blacknose with distaste. Henry said he went into the woods once. The cat lifted his head and gestured withhis nose over the rows of fences toward the garden where Henry lived. That fat old tabby never wentinto the woods, Rusty scoffed.</p><p>He's hardly been beyond his owngarden since his trip to the vet. All he wants to do is eat and sleep. No, really, he caught a robin there,Smudge insisted. Well, if he did,then it was before the vet. Now he complains about birdsbecause they disturb his dozing. Well, anyway, Smudge went on,ignoring the scorn in Rusty's mew. Henry told me there are all sortsof dangerous animals out there. Huge wild cats who eat live rabbits forbreakfast and sharpen their claws on old bones. I'm only going fora look around, Rusty meowed. I won't stay long. Well? Don't say I didn't warn you,purred Smudge.</p><p>The black and white cat turned and plunged off the fence backdown into his own garden. Rusty sat down in the coarsegrass beyond the garden fence. He gave his shoulder a nervous lick and wondered how much ofSmudge's gossip was true. Suddenly, the movement ofa tiny creature caught his eye. He watched it scuttle under some brambles. Instinct made him drop into a low crouch. With one slow paw after another, he drewhis body forward through the undergrowth, ears pricked, nostrils flared, eyesunblinking, he moved toward the animal.</p><p>He could see it clearly now sittingup among the barbed branches, nibbling on a large seedheld between its paws. It was a mouse. Rusty rocked his haunches fromside to side preparing to leap. He held his breath incase his bell rang again. Excitement coursed through him,making his heart pound. This was even better than his dreams. Then a sudden noise of cracking twigs andcrunching leaves made him jump. His bell jangled treacherously, and the mouse darted away into the thickesttangle of the bramble bush. Rusty stood very still and looked around. He could see the white tip of a red bushy tail trailing through a clumpof tall ferns up ahead. He smelled a strong strange scent.</p><p>Definitely a meat eater,but neither cat nor dog. Distracted, Rusty forgotabout the mouse and watched the red tail curiously,he wanted a better look. All of Rusty's senses strainedahead as he prowled forward. Then he detected another noise,it came from behind, but sounded muted and distant. He swiveled his earsbackward to hear it better. Pawsteps, he wondered? But he kept his eyes fixed onthe strange red fur up ahead, and continued to creep onward.</p><p>It was only when the faint rustlingbehind him became a loud and a fast approaching leaf crackle,that Rusty realized he was in danger. The creature hit him like an explosion and Rusty was thrown sidewaysinto a clump of nettles. Twisting and yelling, he tried to throw off the attackerthat had fastened itself to his back. It was gripping him withincredibly sharp claws. Rusty could feel spikedteeth pricking at his neck. He writhed and squirmed from whiskerto tail, but he couldn't free himself. For a second he felt helpless,then he froze.</p><p>Thinking fast,he flipped over onto his back. He knew instinctively how dangerousit was to expose his soft belly, but it was his only chance. He was lucky, the ploy seemed to work. He heard a hoof beneath him as the breathwas knocked out of his attacker. Thrashing fiercely,Rusty managed to wriggle free. Without looking back,he sprinted toward his home. Behind him, a rush of pawsteps toldRusty his attacker was giving chase.</p><p>Even though the pain from hisscratches stung beneath his fur, Rusty decided he would rather turn andfight then let himself be jumped on again. He skidded to a stop,spun around and faced his pursuer. It was another kitten with a thick coatof shaggy gray fur, strong legs, and a broad face. In a heartbeat,Rusty smelled that it was a tom, and sensed the power in the sturdyshoulders underneath the soft coat. Then the kitten crashedinto Rusty at full pelt.</p><p>Taken by surprise by Rusty's turn about,it fell back into a dazed heap. The impact knocked the breathout of Rusty, and he staggered. He quickly found his footing andarched his back, puffing out his orange fur,ready to spring on to the other kitten. But his attacker simply sat up andbegan to lick a forepaw. All signs of aggression gone. Rusty felt strangely disappointed. Every part of him was tense,ready for battle. Hi there kittypet,meowed the gray tom, cheerily. You put up quite a fight for a tame kitty. Rusty remained on tip toe for a second,wondering whether to attack anyway.</p><p>Then he remembered the strengthhe had felt in this kitten's paws when he had pinned him to the ground. He drop onto his pads, loosened hismuscles and let his spine unbend. And I'll fight you again if I have to,he growled. I'm Graypaw, by the way. The gray kitten went on,ignoring Rusty's threat. I'm training to be a ThunderClan warrior. Rusty remained silent. He didn't understand what thisGraywhatsit was meowing about. But he sensed the threat had passed.</p><p>He hid his confusion by leaningdown to lick his ruffled chest. What’s a kittypet like youdoing out in the woods? Don't you know it's dangerous?,asked Graypaw. If you're the most dangerousthing the woods has to offer, then I think I can handle it,Rusty bluffed. Graypaw looked up at him for a moment,narrowing his big yellow eyes. I'm far from the most dangerous. If I were even half a warrior, I'd have given an intruder like yousome real wounds to think about. Rusty felt a thrill of fearat these ominous words. What did this cat mean by intruder? Anyway, meowed Graypaw, using his sharp teeth to tuck a clumpof grass from between his claws.</p><p>I didn't think it was worth hurting you. You're obviously not fromone of the other clans. Other clans? Rusty echoed, confused. Graypaw let out an impatient hiss. He must have heard of the fourwarrior clans that hunt around here. I belong to ThunderClan. The other clans are always tryingto steal prey from our territory, especially ShadowClan. They're so fierce. They would have ripped you to shreds,no questions asked. Graypaw paused to spit angrily andcontinued. They come to take preythat is rightfully ours. It's the job of the ThunderClan warriorsto keep them out of our territory.</p><p>When I finished my training, I'll be so dangerous. I'll have the other clans shakingin their flea bitten skins. They won't dare come near us then. Rusty narrowed his eyes. This must be one of the wild catsSmudge had warned him about. Living rough in the woods,hunting and fighting each other for every last scrap of food. Yet Rusty didn't feel scared. In fact, it was hard not toadmire this confident kitten. So you're not a warrior yet?, he asked. Why, did you thing I was? Graypaw purred proudly.</p><p>Then he shook his wide furry head. I won't be a real warrior for ages. I have to go through the training first. Kits have to be six moons oldbefore they even begin training. Tonight is my first nightout as an apprentice. Why don't you find yourself an ownerwith a nice cozy house instead? Your life would be much easier,Rusty meowed. There are plenty of housefolkwho'd take in a kitten like you. All you have to do is sit where theycan see you and look hungry for a couple of days. And they'd feed me pellets that looklike rabbit droppings and soft slop! Graypaw interrupted, no way, I can't thinkof anything worse than being a kitty pet. They're nothing but Twoleg toys. Eating stuff that doesn't look like food,making dirt in a box of gravel. Sticking their noses outside only whenthe Twolegs allow them, that's no life.</p><p>Out here it's wild and it's free,we come and go as we please. He finished his speech with a proud spit,then meowed mischievously. Until you've tasted a fresh-killed mouse,you haven't lived. Have you ever tasted mouse? No, Rusty admitted a little defensively. Not yet. I guess you'll never understand,Graypaw sighed. You weren't born wild,it makes a big difference. You need to be born withwarrior blood in your veins, or the feel of the wind in your whiskers. Kitties born into Twoleg nestscould never feel the same way. Rusty remembered the wayhe had felt in his dream. That's not true. He mewed indignantly. Graypaw did not reply. He suddenly stiffened mid-lick,one paw still raised, and sniffed the air.</p><p>I smell cats from my Clan, he hissed. You should go. They won't be pleased to findyou hunting in our territory. Rusty looked around, wondering howGraypaw knew any cat was approaching. He couldn't smell anything differenton the leaf-scented breeze, but his fur stood on end at the noteof urgency in Graypaw's voice. Quick! Hissed Graypaw again.</p><p>Run!. Rusty prepared to spring into the bushes,not knowing which way was safe to jump. He was too late. A voice meowed behind him,firm and menacing. What's going on here? Rusty turned to see a large grayshe-cat strolling majestically out from the undergrowth. She was magnificent. White hair streaked her muzzle and an uglyscar parted the fur across her shoulders. But her smooth gray coat shonelike silver in the moonlight. Bluestar. Beside Rusty, Graypaw crouched down andnarrowed his eyes.</p><p>He crouched even lower when a second cat,a handsome, golden tabby, followed the gray cat into the clearing. You shouldn't be sonear Twolegplace, Graypaw, growled the golden tabby angrily,narrowing his green eyes. I know, Lionheart, I'm sorry. Graypaw looked down at his paws. Rusty copied Graypaw andcrouched low to the forest floor, his ears twitching nervously. These cats had an air of strength he hadnever seen in any of his garden friends. Maybe what Smudge hadwarned him about was true. Who is this? Asked the she-cat.</p><p>Rusty flinched andshe turned her gaze on him. Her piercing blue eyes madehim feel even more vulnerable. He's no threat, meowed Graypaw quickly. He's not another Clan warrior, justa Twoleg pet from beyond our territories. Just a Twoleg pet? The words inflamed Rusty buthe held his tongue. The warning look in Bluestar's staretold him that she had observed the anger in his eyes and he looked away. This is Bluestar,she's the leader of my Clan, Graypaw hissed to Rusty under his breath. And Lionheart, he's my mentor, whichmeans he's training me to be a warrior.</p><p>Thank you for the introduction,Graypaw, meowed Lionheart coolly. Bluestar was still staring at Rusty. You fight well fora Twoleg pet, she meowed. Rusty andGraypaw exchanged confused glances. How could she know? We have been watching you both,Bluestar went on, as if she had read their thoughts. We wondered how you would dealwith an intruder, Graypaw. You attacked him bravely. Graypaw looked pleasedat Bluestar's praise. Sit up now, both of you. Bluestar looked at Rusty.</p><p>You, too, kittypet. He sat up immediately and held Bluestar'sgaze evenly as she addressed him. You reacted well to the attack, kittypet. Graypaw is stronger than you, butyou used your wits to defend yourself. And you turned to facehim when he chased you. I've not seen a kittypet do that before. Rusty managed to nod his thanks,taken aback by such unexpected praise. Her next words surprised him even more. I have been wondering how you wouldperform out here beyond the Twolegplace.</p><p>We patrol this border frequently. So I have often seen you sitting on yourboundary, staring out into the forest. And now, at last,you have dared to place your paws here. Bluestar stared at Rusty thoughtfully. You do seem to have a naturalhunting ability, sharp eyes. You would have caught that mouseif you had not hesitated so long. Really? Rusty stammered. Lionheart spoke now, his deep meowwas respectful but insistent. Bluestar, this is a kittypet, he shouldnot be hunting in ThunderClan territory. Send him home to his Twolegs. Rusty prickled at Lionheart'sdismissive words.</p><p>Send me home? He mewed impatiently. Bluestar's words hadmade him glow with pride. She had noticed him. She had been impressed by him. But I've only come here to hunt fora mouse or two. I’m sure there's enough to go around. Bluestar had turned her head toacknowledge Lionheart's words. Now her gaze snapped back to Rusty. Her blue eyes were blazing with anger. There's never enough to go around,she spat. If you didn't live such a soft,overfed life, you would know that.</p><p>Rusty was confused byBluestar's sudden rage. But one glance at the horrifiedlook on Graypaw's face was enough to tell himhe had spoken too freely. Lionheart stepped to his leader's side. Both warriors loomed over him now. Rusty looked into Bluestar's threateningstare and his pride dissolved. These were not cozy,fireside cats he was dealing with. They were mean, hungry cats, who were probably going tofinish what Graypaw had started.</p>
