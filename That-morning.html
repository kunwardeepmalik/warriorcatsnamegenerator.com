              <p>That morning, as Rusty slept off his night's wanderings, the mouse fantasy came again, more vibrant than before. Free of his collar, underneath the moon, he stalked the shy creature. However, this time he had been conscious of being watched. Shining in the corners of the woods he saw heaps of yellowish eyes. The Clan cats had entered his fantasy world.</p><p>Rusty woke, blinking in the bright sunlight which has been flowing throughout the kitchen floor. His fur felt thick and heavy with heat. His food bowl was topped up, along with his water bowl pops out and full of bitter-tasting Twoleg water. Rusty preferred drinking out of puddles out, but if it had been hot, or he</p><p>Was quite thirsty, he had to confess it had been simpler to lap the water up inside. Can he actually abandon this cozy life? He ate, then pushed his way from the cat flap to the backyard. The day promised to be hot, and the backyard was thick with the odor of ancient blossoms. Mewed a voice in the fence. It had been Smudge. "You ought to have been awake an hour ago. The infant sparrows were outside extending their wings"</p><p>"Can you catch any?" Rusty asked. "Could not be bothered. I had already eaten at home. Anyhow, why were not you out sooner Yesterday you're whining about Henry sleeping away his time, and now you are not better " Rusty sat down on the cool ground with all the weapon and then curled his tail over his front paws. "I had been in the woods last night," he informed his friend. At once he felt that the blood flow in his veins and his fur .</p><p>Can you catch anything? Or did anything grab you?" Rusty paused, not certain how to tell his older friend what had occurred. "I met a few crazy cats," he started. Smudge was obviously shocked.  Rusty may feel the power surging through his body as he remembered the power and strength of their Clan cats. Smudge motivated him .</p><p>Larger and more powerful than any people." "And you also fought every one of these "  "Only the most adorable one; another two came afterwards." "How come they did not embarrass you to pieces?"</p><p>"They simply warned me to leave their land. But ..." Rusty hesitated.  "They asked me to join Clan." Rusty insisted. "Why do they do this?" "I really don't understand," Rusty confessed. "I believe they want additional paws within their Clan." "Sounds a little strange for me," Smudge mewed doubtfully. "I would not expect them if I were you"</p><p>His black buddy hadn't ever shown any interest in entering the woods. He had been perfectly happy living with his housefolk. He'd never know the nervous longing that Rusty's dreams awakened night after night. "However, I really do hope," Rusty purred lightly. "And I have made my mind up. I will combine them."</p><p>"Please do not go, Rusty," that he mewed in alert. "I would never find you again." Rusty nudged him with his mind. "Do not worry. My housefolk will find another cat. You will receive on with him nice. You get together with everybody!" "However, it will not be the same!" Smudge wailed. Rusty twitched his tail . "That is just the point. If I live around here until they take me to the Cutter, I will not be the exact same either." Smudge appeared puzzled. He forfeited. "The vet," Rusty clarified.</p><p>"To be changed, such as Henry was"  "I mean, I understand he is a bit lazier today, but he is not miserable. We might still have fun" Rusty felt his heart fill with despair at the idea of leaving his buddy. "I am sorry, Smudge. I will miss you, but I must go." Smudge did not answer, but stepped forward and softly touched Rusty's nose with his very own.</p><p>I will see I can not stop you, but let's spend yet another morning " Rusty found himself appreciating the afternoon more than normal, seeing his old haunts with Smudge, sharing words with all the cats he'd grown up with. Each of his senses felt supercharged, as though he had been poised ahead of a massive jump. Since sunhigh approached, Rusty grew increasingly impatient to determine if Lionheart would truly be awaiting him. The idle buzz of meows from his older buddies seemed to fade in the background as most of his perceptions strained toward the forests.</p><p>Rusty jumped from his backyard fencing for the last time and sneaked in the woods. He'd stated his good-byes into Smudge. His ideas were concentrated on the woods as well as the cats that dwelt inside.</p><p>As he approached the place where he'd met with all the Clan cats at the night beforehe sat down and tasted the atmosphere. Tall trees guarded the floor from the midday sunshine, which makes it comfortably trendy. Here and there a patch of sun shone through a gap from the leaves and lit up the forest ground. Rusty could smell exactly the same</p><p>Cat-scent as last night, but he had no idea if it was new or old. He raised his head and sniffed uncertainly.</p><p>"You have a great deal to learn," meowed a profound voice. "The smallest Clan kit understands if the other cat is nearby." Rusty saw a set of green eyes glinting from under a bramble bush. He recognized the odor: it had been Lionheart. "Could you tell if I'm alone?" Requested the gold tabby, stepping to the light. The aromas of Bluestar and Graypaw were there, but maybe not as powerful as the previous night. Hesitantly, he mewed,"Bluestar and Graypaw are not with you this moment." "That is correct," meowed Lionheart. "But somebody else is" Rusty stiffened as another Clan cat strode to the clearing.</p><p>"That can be Whitestorm," purred Lionheart. "Among ThunderClan's senior warriors" Rusty looked in the tom and sensed his spine tingle with cold panic. Long-bodied and muscular, Whitestorm stood facing Rusty and gazed down at him. His white coat was thick and dull and his eyes were all the yellow of sunbaked sand. Rusty flattened his ears , and tensed his muscles in preparation for a struggle.</p><p>"We're here just to take you to our camp" Rusty sat very still, barely daring to breathe, as Whitestorm extended his nose gave him a curious sniff.</p><p>"Hi, young one," murmured the white cat. "I have heard a good deal about you." "Come, we could talk more once we're at the camp," arranged Lionheart, and, without pausing, he and Whitestorm jumped into the undergrowth. Rusty jumped into his paws and followed as fast as he would. Both warriors left no allowances for Rusty because they sped through the woods, and before long he had been unable to maintain. Their speed hardly slowed as they directed him fallen trees they stuck in one jump, but that Rusty had to scramble over paw by paw.</p><p>They passed sharply aromatic pine trees, in which they needed to leap across deep gullies churned up with a Twoleg tree-eater. In the security of the backyard fence, Rusty had frequently heard it roaring and snarling in the space. 1 gully was too wide to leap, half-filled with slimy, foul-smelling water. The Clan cats waded through without even hesitating. Rusty hadn't ever place a paw in water . However he was determined to not show any indications of weakness, therefore he narrowed his eyes followedtrying to ignore the uncomfortable wetness that soaked his stomach fur. Rusty skidded to a stop behind them stood while</p><p>That the 2 warriors stepped on a stone that rested on the border of a little ravine. "We are extremely near our camp today," meowed Lionheart. Rusty strained to find any signs of life--transferring leaves, a glimpse of fur one of the bushes beneath, however, his eyes saw nothing but exactly the exact same undergrowth that covered the remainder of the forest floor.</p><p>You ought to have the ability to scent it," hissed Whitestorm impatiently. Rusty shut his eyes and sniffed. Whitestorm was suitable. The scents were quite distinct from the cat-scent that he used to. The air smelled more powerful, talking of many, many distinct cats. He nodded thoughtfully and declared,"I will smell cats"</p><p>"There'll come a moment, if you're accepted in the Clan, once you will know every cat-scent by title," Lionheart meowed. He headed the way nimbly down the boulders into the base of the ravine, and pushed his way through a thick patch of gorse. Rusty followed, also Whitestorm took up the back.</p><p>As his hands scraped against the prickly gorse, Rusty looked down and discovered the grass under his head was flattened to a wide, strong-smelling track. This has to be the major entry into the camp, he believed. Past the gorse, a clearing opened . The floor at the center has been bare, hard ground, shaped by several</p><p>This camp was here a very long time. The clearing was dappled by sunlight, and also the air felt hot and still. There were cats everywhere, sitting independently or in groups, sharing meals or purring softly as they dressed one another. "Only after sunhigh, once the evening is latest, is a time for discussing tongues," Lionheart clarified.</p><p>Rusty echoed. "Clan cats constantly spend some time grooming each other and sharing the information of this day," Whitestorm advised him. It's a habit that binds the members of this Clan together" The cats had clearly smelled Rusty's foreign odor, for heads started to turn and stare strangely in his leadership.</p><p>Suddenly shy of fulfilling any kitty's gaze straight, Rusty looked round the clearing. It was garnished with thick grass, dotted with treestumps along with a tree. A thick curtain of ferns and gorse protected the camp in the remaining woods.</p><p>"Over time," meowed Lionheart, flicking his tail with the impenetrable-looking tangle of brambles,"is your nursery, in which the kits have been cared for." He could not see through the knot of prickly branches, but he can listen to the mewling of many kittens from someplace inside. As he watcheda ginger she-cat squirmed out via a little gap at the front.</p><p>That has to be one of those queens, Rusty thought. A tabby queen with black markings appeared round the bramble bush. The 2 she-cats exchanged a friendly lick involving the ears until the tabby slipped in the nursery, murmuring into the</p><p>"care of our kits is shared with each one the queens," meowed Lionheart. "All cats function the Clan. Loyalty into the Clan is the very first law within our warrior code, a lesson that you should learn fast in the event that you would like to remain with us"</p><p>Rusty sniffed the atmosphere also, and was happy he managed to recognize the odor of this grey she-cat a minute before she looked out of the shadow of a massive boulder that lay together in the head of this clearing. "He arrived" Bluestar purred, addressing the warriors.</p><p>Whitestorm responded,"Lionheart was convinced he wouldn't." Rusty discovered the suggestion of Bluestar's tail twitch impatiently. "Well, what do you think about him?" she asked.</p><p>"He maintained nicely on the return journey, regardless of his puny dimensions," Whitestorm declared. "He definitely seems powerful to get a kittypet." "So it's agreed?" Bluestar appeared at Lionheart and Whitestorm. Both cats .</p><p>"Then I will announce his arrival into the Clan." Bluestar leaped up on the boulder and yowled,"Let all those cats enough to catch their own prey unite here under the Highrock to get a Clan assembly" Her apparent telephone brought each of the cats trotting toward her, appearing like liquid shadows out of the borders of the clearing.</p><p>Another cats settled themselves under the Highrock and looked expectantly up in their own leader. Rusty felt a rush of relief because he comprehended Graypaw's thick grey fur one of the cats. A big dark grey tabby crouched behind them, the stripes on his fur appearing just like shadows onto a moonlit forest floor. When the cats were nevertheless, Bluestar discussed. "ThunderClan wants more warriors," she started.</p><p>It's been determined that ThunderClan will take within an outsider to train as a warrior...." Rusty heard indignant mutterings erupt one of the Clan cats, but Bluestar silenced them with a company yowl. "I have found a kitty who's prepared to become an apprentice of ThunderClan."</p><p>"Lucky to become an apprentice," caterwauled a loud voice over the form of shock that propagate throughout cats. Rusty craned his neck and watched a pale tabby cat standing up and glaring defiantly in the chief.</p><p>Bluestar dismissed the tabby and addressed all her Clan. "Lionheart and Whitestorm have fulfilled this young kitten, and they concur with me that we ought to train him with another apprentices." Rusty appeared in Lionheart, then again in the Clan, to locate all eyes were on him today.</p><p>There was quiet for an instant. Rusty was convinced they must all have the ability to listen to his heart and odor his fear-scent. Presently a deafening crescendo of caterwauling climbed in the audience.</p><p> "What a peculiar odor he conveys! That is not the odor of any Clan I understand!" Then 1 yowl specifically sounded out over the rest.</p><p>"Look in his collar! He is a kittypet!" It was the light tabby again. "After a kittypet, constantly a kittypet. This Clan requires wildborn warriors to defend it, another soft mouth ." Lionheart bent down and hissed to Rusty's ear,"This tabby is Longtail.</p><p>All of them do. You have to prove to him along with the other cats your fear will not hold you back" However, Rusty could not move. How can he prove to such ferocious cats that he was not only a kittypet?</p><p>"Your collar is a symbol of this Twolegs, which noisy jingling will turn you into a bad hunter in the best. At worst, it is going to bring the Twolegs to our land, trying to find the bad lost kittypet who matches the forests with his pathetic tinkling."</p><p>Each of the cats howled in arrangement. Longtail went , well aware that he had the aid of his crowd. "The sound of your treacherous bell will alert our enemies, even though your Twoleg stench does not!" Lionheart hissed to Rusty's ear :"Can you back down from a battle?" Rusty still didn't proceed.</p><p>However, this time he had been hoping to stabilize Longtail's position. There he was, only supporting a dusky queen. Rusty flattened his ears, narrowed his eyes , hissing, leaped through the startled cats to put himself on his tormentor. Longtail was utterly unprepared for Rusty's assault.</p><p>Filled with anger and desperate to prove himselfRusty dug his claws deep into the tabby kitty's fur and sank into his teeth. No subtle rituals of boxing and swiping preceded this particular fight. Both cats were locked at a crying, writhing tussle that flipped and somersaulted across the clearing in the core of the camp.</p><p>Another cats needed to spring from the way to avert the screeching whirlwind of fur. As Rusty scratched and fought, he was suddenly conscious that he felt no fear, just exhilaration.</p><p>Throughout the roaring of the blood in his ears, he can hear the cats wailing with enthusiasm. Subsequently Rusty felt that his collar tighten round his throat. Longtail had gripped it between his teeth and has been tugging, and yanking hard. Rusty felt a dreadful pressure at his throat. Not able to breathe, he began to panic.</p><p>He writhed and twisted, but every movement just made the strain worse. Retching and gulping for air, he summoned up all of his strength and attempted to pull off from Longtail's grip. And with a loud snap, he had been liberated. Longtail tumbled from him. </p><p>At the same time, Bluestar jumped down in the Highrock and silenced the noisy audience with a thunderous caterwaul. Rusty and Longtail stayed fixed to the place, gasping for breath. Clumps of fur dangled in their ruffled coats. Rusty could sense a cut offs over his attention. Longtail's left ear was badly torn, and blood flow down his slender shoulders on the dusty ground. They stared at each other, their desperation not yet invested.</p><p>She put it on the floor before her and meowed,"The rookie has dropped his Twoleg collar at a struggle for his honor. StarClan has spoken its acceptance --this cat was discharged from the aid of his Twoleg owners, and is totally free to combine ThunderClan within an apprentice."</p><p>Rusty appeared at Bluestar and solemnly nodded his approval. He stood up and stepped into a shaft of sun, welcoming the heat on his tender muscles. The pool of light blazed glowing on his orange pelt, which makes his fur shine. Rusty raised his head and looked in the cats who encompassed him. This Moment</p><p>No kitty claimed or jeered. He had revealed himself to be a worthy competitor in battle. Bluestar approached Rusty and put the shredded collar onto the floor in front of him. She touched his ear softly with her nose. "You appear to be a new passion in this sunshine," she murmured.</p><p>Her eyes flashed briefly, as if her voice had more significance for her Rusty understood. Then she switched into the Clan and declared,"From that day forward, until he's earned his warrior title, this apprentice is going to be known as Firepaw, with regard to his flame-colored coat"</p><p>She stepped back and forth, together with all the other cats, waited for his second movement. Without hesitating, Rusty kicked and turned dirt and bud over his collar like hammering his dirt. Longtail growled and limped from the clearing toward a fern-shaded corner. The cats divide into classes, murmuring to each other .</p><p>Rusty heard Graypaw's friendly voice . Firepaw! A joy of pride jumped in the noise of the new name. He turned out to greet the grey apprentice having a welcoming sniff. mewed Graypaw. Longtail is a warrior, even though he just completed his coaching two moons past.</p><p>That scar you left his ear will not let him forget you in a hurry. You have loathed his great looks, that is for certain." "He set up quite a struggle, however!" He licked his front paw and started to wash clean the deep scrape that stung over his attention. As he heard his name , echoing one of the meows of cats.</p><p> Firepaw shut his eyes for a minute and allow the listeners wash him. "Great name, also!" Firepaw appeared around. "Where did Longtail creep off ?" "I believe he had been going toward Spottedleaf's den." "She is our medication cat. Maybe not bad-looking either. Younger and a good deal prettier than many" A very low yowl beside the 2 cats ceased Graypaw midspeech. They turned, and Firepaw recognized that the effective grey tabby cat who'd sat Graypaw earlier.</p><p>The slick tom looked in Firepaw for an instant. "Lucky your collar snapped as it did. Longtail is a youthful warrior, however, I can not imagine him being defeated by a kittypet!"</p><p>"Today Darkstripe," Graypaw hissed into Firepaw beneath his breath,"is young, nor quite" Firepaw was going to concur with his new buddy when he was interrupted by a warning yowl in an older grey cat sitting in the edge of this clearing. Graypaw meowed, instantly alert.</p><p>Firepaw barely had the time to look about before a young cat crashed through the bushes and to the camp. He was lanky and--besides the white tip of the long, slender tail--jet black from head to toe.</p><p>"That is Ravenpaw! Where is Tigerclaw?" Firepaw appeared at Ravenpaw staggering across the ground of this clearing. His jacket was dusty, and his eyes were wild with fear. Firepaw whispered to Graypaw, as many other cats hurried past</p><p>Him to greet the new birth. Tigerclaw's his mentor," Graypaw clarified quickly. "Ravenpaw went outside with Tigerclaw and Redtail at dawn on a mission against RiverClan, the blessed furball!" Firepaw echoed, completely perplexed by these names. "But why in the world has Ravenpaw return alone?" He added . He raised his head to listen as Bluestar resigned.</p><p>The she-cat talked calmly, but a look of stress clouded her eyes that were blue. The other cats returned, curling their lips together with stress. "What's happened?" Bluestar jumped on the Highrock and looked down at the cat. "Chat, Ravenpaw!"</p><p>Ravenpaw was struggling for breath, and his sides heaved fitfully while the dust turned red with blood, but he was able to scramble up on the Highrock and stand together with Bluestar. He turned into the audience of faces that surrounded him, and summoned sufficient breath to announce,"Redtail is dead!"</p>
